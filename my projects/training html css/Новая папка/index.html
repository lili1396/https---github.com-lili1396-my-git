            <p>France’s most serviced international airport is Charles de Gaulle, just outside of Paris. Flights from New York to Paris takes around seven hours; from Los Angeles it takes 11 hours. Once in Paris, you have numerous transportation options to travel around France. Domestic and charter flights generally depart from Orly airport just south of Paris. Trains connecting you to nearly every destination in France and Europe leave from a number of Paris’ centrally located gares (train stations). </p>
